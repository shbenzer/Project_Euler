Includes 3 solutions;

    Solution 1: abhorently slow; memory intensive; processes strings in their entirety
    Solution 2: abhorently slow; less memory intensive; processes representations of strings instead
    Solution 3: UNFINISHED: much faster; much less memory intensive; calculates length of sequence with needed index, then attempts to determine which string index is in
